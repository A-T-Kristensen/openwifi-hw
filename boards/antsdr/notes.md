## Work to be done
The antsdr has RF switch in the front-end, for now, the RF switch is fixed at a higer range, which will isolation the frequency below 3GHz and pass the frequency at 3GHz~6GHz. 
For future work, it can add the rf swicth control in the devicetree, and this will change the rf switch with the frequency change.
